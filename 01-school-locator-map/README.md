# 01 School Locator Map

## Objective
#  Mapping Schools in Kumasi metropolitan

This project visualizes the distribution of schools in the kumasi metropolitan assembly, Ghana.  
Using dummy spatial data, it demonstrates how GIS can support educational planning by showing school locations, categories, and accessibility gaps.  
Outputs include a locator map, summary statistics, and recommendations for equitable educational resource allocation.
- Collect and clean dummy school data (location, category, name).
- Visualize schools on a map using **QGIS**.
- Categorize schools by type (Primary, JHS, SHS).
- Create a **thematic map** to support decision-making in education.

## Data and Tools
- **GIS Software:** QGIS (open-source)  
- **Data:**  dataset created in Excel (Name, Category, Coordinates)  
- **Visualization:** Symbolized points by category with labels

## Steps
1. Open schools_data.csv in QGIS.
2. Add as point layer and style by 'level'.
3. Export map to images/schools_map.png
- Add real datasets from Ghana Education Service (GES) for validation.  
- Perform **buffer analysis** (e.g., how many households live within 1km of a school).  
- Integrate into a dashboard (Power BI / Tableau) for interactive exploration.  

## Outputs
- Map, dashboard, or chart
